<p class="bg-primary-light p-3"><span class="font-bold">Note:</span> The term Urban Air Mobility (UAM) was used in the original title of the research project. The term has been since modified to Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and encompasses UAM.</p>

ACRP 03-50A provides tools and guidance on the potential impacts and integration of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) at airports of different sizes and levels of activity. AAM initiatives are rapidly advancing, and airports need to understand both the challenges and opportunities for AAM and how new players to aviation will impact and benefit airports.

The research will assist the airport planning and engineering communities across the United States as they prepare plans to meet forecasted growth, and carefully evaluate the implications of electrically powered VTOL vehicles. Even more important, the research will provide airport owners and their facilities managers guidance on updating and revising master plans to reflect broader trends driving electrification, mobility, and the role of airports in their communities. At the same time, the significant uncertainty surrounding both technology and regulation needs to be conveyed, along with supporting guidance on managing planning efforts amid such uncertainty. Airports and their stakeholders will benefit from a comprehensive review of existing and anticipated case studies and applications for AAM at airports, illustrating the market opportunity and risks, as well as providing insight as to how airports should be positioning themselves in regard to the emerging AAM industry.

## The Go/No-Go Decision

The airport readiness assessment is a straightforward process of systematically evaluating an airport’s capabilities across three key areas: awareness, readiness, and infrastructure.  

Four readiness levels will help determine an airport’s path forward for AAM integration.

  </ol>
  
Understanding the readiness level will inform airport practitioners in how to best focus their planning efforts. The readiness level is not the primary focus of the assessment; rather, gaining an understanding of agency capability and potential gaps relative to key readiness criteria. To better assist in filling these gaps, the assessment provides references to specific guidebook sections.
