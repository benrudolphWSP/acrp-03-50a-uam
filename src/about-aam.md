Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has raised worldwide interest in providing a new mode of transportation that brings a new generation of travel, package delivery, and new aerial vehicles to the skies. Concerns regarding climate change, greenhouse gases, traffic congestion, and frustration with current transportation systems have prompted extensive research and funding to help mitigate these issues. Industry has long sought ways to address the widespread and complex problems of congestion, pollution, and access to efficient, convenient, and affordable transportation options. One such option, Urban Air Mobility (UAM), is poised to bring major benefits to the air transport and surface transport sectors with the potential to change the way people live and work.

UAM initiatives are rapidly advancing and have the potential to change future transportation options in drastic ways. There are unique opportunities for airports to play a vital role in this nascent industry. Airports provide many growth opportunities to connect communities and bring new transportation options to the underserved. 

The ACRP 03-50A research project provides airport industry practitioners with information about the rapidly forming UAM movement and helps advise practitioners on items essential to preparing for this new industry.
