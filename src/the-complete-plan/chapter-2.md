Federal legislation and related planning regulations require MPOs to produce a long-range RTP, a five-year transportation improvement program (TIP), and an annual unified planning work program. Moving Forward is the RTP for fiscal years 2022–2050 for the NYMTC planning area. Moving Forward includes forecasts of future conditions and needs and potential transportation improvements, as well as a shared strategic vision for transportation and development within the NYMTC planning area. NYMTC’s Shared Vision for Regional Mobility, which guides Moving Forward, is built from a framework of its members and advisers’ strategic goals; associated objectives; and related projects, programs, and studies.
