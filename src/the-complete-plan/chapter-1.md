The elected and appointed officials who make up the NYMTC recognize that mobility—the ability of people and goods to move easily and safely to, from, and between locations—is crucial to the lives of everyone who lives, works, or visits the NYMTC planning area. Therefore, we aspire to (1) ensure that the mobility provided reaches everyone in a sustainable, healthy, and equitable manner; (2) invest efficiently for these transportation needs; and (3) respond effectively to the transportation challenges of tomorrow. The Vision and Goals, Guiding Principles, and Objectives described in this chapter were employed throughout the Moving Forward planning process.
