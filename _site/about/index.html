    <div class="lg:px-6 lg:py-8"><p>ACRP 03-50A provides tools and guidance on the potential impacts &amp; integration of Urban Air Mobility on airports of different sizes and levels of activity.  Urban Air Mobility (UAM) initiatives are rapidly advancing, and airports are excited to understand the challenges and opportunities for Urban Air Mobility as well as how new players to aviation will impact and benefit them. The research will assist the airport planning and engineering communities across the United States (U.S.) as they are thinking about and preparing plans to meet the forecasted growth and are carefully evaluating the implications of electrically powered VTOL vehicles, thus, the timeliness of this study is even more important to provide airport owners and their facilities managers guidance on updating and revising master plans to reflect broader trends driving electrification, mobility, and the role of airports in their communities. At the same time, the significant uncertainty surrounding both technology and regulation needs to be conveyed, along with supporting guidance on managing planning efforts amid such uncertainty. Airports and their stakeholders will benefit from a comprehensive review of existing and anticipated case studies and applications for UAM at airports, illustrating the market opportunity and risks, as well as providing insight as to how airports should be positioning themselves in regard to the emerging UAM industry.</p>
<h2>The Go/No-Go Decision</h2>
<p>The assessment is a straightforward process of systematically evaluating the airportâ€™s capabilities concerning three key areas: awareness, readiness, and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The readiness levels are categorized into four levels to help determine a path forward for UAM integration at this stage.</p>
  <ol class="flex justify-between ml-0 text-center">
      <li class=" list-none m-0 border-t-8 border-error flex-1 pt-3 font-bold text-lg">No-go</li>
      <li class=" list-none m-0 border-t-8 border-orange flex-1 pt-3 font-bold text-lg">Not-now</li>
      <li class=" list-none m-0 border-t-8 border-yellow flex-1 pt-3 font-bold text-lg">Slow-go</li>
      <li class=" list-none m-0 border-t-8 border-green flex-1 pt-3 font-bold text-lg">Go-now</li>
  </ol>
<p>Understanding the readiness level can assist airport practitioners in areas to focus their efforts. The value of the level is not the focus of the assessment as much as gaining an understanding of agency capability and potential gaps relative to the criteria.  To better assist in filling these gaps, the assessment will provide references to specific guidebook areas to help provide information on key areas for success.</p>
